# Intro of the codes
These codes included in the R script is for my research project of my master thesis in Erasmus University Rotterdam, major MSC of Data Science and Marketing Analytics. The aim of the project is to figure out what are the most important features of the smartphone sales, and then use SVM, RF and NN to make predictions then make recommendations based on the results.
# Data Description
The data used in the project -- IDC Worldwide Smartphone Tracker Data, is sourced from the International Data Corporation (IDC). The data is provided in the form of two distinct .xlsx files, collectively amounting to a substantial 292 MB, including 40 features of worldwide smartphones information, and the sales.
